Metro Rail app in VS Code using Graph and Heap that takes information of source and destination station, from the user and displays the fare and shortest metro route between the stations. It also has a metro map for commuterâ€™s better navigation.

The nodes in the graph represent stations that contain information like name, metro corridor, and connection lines. Edges represent distance between two stations and cost of each edge is the distance between the two of its connecting stations(nodes).

Used algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS and DFS to determine shortest path between source and destination station.

Tech Stack: Vs Code, Java Collections Framework (JCF).
